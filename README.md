Hi, Iâ€™m FanÃ©lie BACHELET ðŸ˜€ <br/>
I am specialized in **Plant Biology and Physiology** ðŸŒ¿, using especially **Molecular biology** ðŸ§¬ <br/>
I have just completed my PhD project: *Role of PsSULTR4-mediated vacuolar sulfate remobilization in seed development and leaf senescence in pea: contribution to seed production and quality* :seedling: :leaves: <br/>
During this project, I have worked in [INRAE French lab](https://umr-agroecologie.dijon.hub.inrae.fr/recherche/poles-de-recherche/legae), in collaboration with  [COS lab in Germany](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research-groups/molecular-biology-of-plants). <br/>
I notably published a research article in Plant Journal in 2024 [(DOI)](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.16961), and I contributed to the writing of a review article in 2023 [(DOI)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erad098) :pencil2: <br/>
I am highly motivated and I am looking for a position to contribute to **R&D projects** aiming to study plant nutrition of crops species, and cultivation techniques and systems, to provide knowledge for sustainable agriculture :tractor: </br>
I am currently in France :fr:, but I would be happy to go to Switzerland :switzerland: <br/>
